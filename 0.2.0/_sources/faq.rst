I cannot install ``giotto-tda``
-------------------------------

We are trying our best to support a variety of widely-used operating systems. Please navigate to
:ref:`Installation <installation>` and review the steps outlined there. Take care of the differences
between a simple user installation and a more involved developer installation from sources.
If you still experience issues, it is possible others also have encountered and reported them.
Please consult the list of `issues <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/issues?q=is%3Aissue>`_,
including the closed ones, and open a new one in case you did not find help.

There are many TDA libraries available. How is ``giotto-tda`` different?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

``giotto-tda`` is oriented towards machine learning (for details, see the :ref:`guiding principles <guiding_principles>`).
This philosophy is in contrast with other reference libraries, like `GUDHI <https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/index.html>`_,
which provide more low-level functionality at the expense of being less adapted to e.g. batch processing, or of
being tightly integrated with ``scikit-learn``.
