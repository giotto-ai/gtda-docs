**********************
Developer installation
**********************

Installing both the PyPI release and source of giotto-tda in the same environment is not recommended since it is
known to cause conflicts with the C++ bindings.

The developer installation requires three important C++ dependencies:

-  A C++14 compatible compiler
-  CMake >= 3.9
-  Boost >= 1.56

Please refer to your system's instructions and to the `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ and
`Boost <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/more/getting_started/index.html>`_ websites for definitive guidance on how to install these dependencies. The instructions below are unofficial, please follow them at your own risk.

Linux
=====

Most Linux systems should come with a suitable compiler pre-installed. For the other two dependencies, you may consider using your distribution's package manager, e.g. by running

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-dev

if ``apt-get`` is available in your system.

macOS
=====

On macOS, you may consider using ``brew`` (https://brew.sh/) to install the dependencies as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install gcc cmake boost

Windows
=======

On Windows, you will likely need to have `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`_ installed. At present,
it appears to be important to have a recent version of the VS C++ compiler. One way to check whether this is the case
is as follows: 1) open the VS Installer GUI; 2) under the "Installed" tab, click on "Modify" in the relevant VS
version; 3) in the newly opened window, select "Individual components" and ensure that v14.24 or above of the MSVC
"C++ x64/x86 build tools" is selected. The CMake and Boost dependencies are best installed using the latest binary
executables from the websites of the respective projects.


Source code
===========

You can obtain the latest state of the source code with the command::

    git clone https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda.git


To install:
===========

.. code-block:: bash

   cd giotto-tda
   python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

This way, you can pull the library's latest changes and make them immediately available on your machine.
Note: we recommend upgrading ``pip`` and ``setuptools`` to recent versions before installing in this way.

Testing
=======

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the
source directory::

    pytest gtda

The giotto-tda team will review your pull requests. Once the pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration checks, the
giotto-tda team will work on getting your pull request submitted to our GitHub
repository. Eventually, your pull request will be merged automatically on GitHub.
If you want to contribute, start working through the giotto-tda codebase,
navigate to the `GitHub issue tab <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/issues>`_
and start looking through interesting issues. These are issues that we believe

Contribution guidelines and standards
=====================================

Before sending your pull request for review, make sure your changes are
consistent with the guidelines and follow the coding style below.

General guidelines and philosophy for contribution
--------------------------------------------------

* Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to
  a) prove that your code works correctly, and
  b) guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.
* Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs
  usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
* Keep API compatibility in mind when you change code in core giotto-tda.
* Clearly define your exceptions using the utils functions and test the exceptions.
* When you contribute a new feature to giotto-tda, the maintenance burden is   
  (by default) transferred to the giotto-tda team. This means that the benefit   
  of the contribution must be compared against the cost of maintaining the   
  feature.

C++ coding style
----------------

Changes to giotto-tda's C/C++ code should conform to `Google C++ Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_.
Use `clang-tidy` to check your C/C++ changes. To install `clang-tidy` on
ubuntu:16.04, do:


.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install -y clang-tidy

You can check a C/C++ file by doing:

.. code-block:: bash

    clang-format <my_cc_file> --style=google > /tmp/my_cc_file.ccdiff <my_cc_file> /tmp/my_cc_file.cc

Python coding style
-------------------

Changes to giotto-tda's Python code should conform to PEP8 directives.
Use `flake8` to check your Python changes. To install `flake8` just do

.. code-block:: python

    pip install flake8

You can use `flake8` on your python code via the following instructions:

.. code-block:: python

    flake8 name_of_your_script.py

Git pre-commit hook
-------------------
We provide a pre-commit git hook to prevent accidental commits to the master branch. To activate, run

.. code-block:: bash

    cd .git/hooks
    ln -s ../../.tools/git-pre-commit pre-commit

Running unit tests
------------------

There are two ways to run unit tests for giotto-tda.

1. Using tools and libraries installed directly on your system. The election tool is `pytest`. To install `pytest` just do

.. code-block:: python

    pip install pytest

You can use `pytest` on your python code via the following instructions:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest name_of_your_script.py

2. Using Azure (azure-pipelines.yml) and giotto-tda's CI scripts.
