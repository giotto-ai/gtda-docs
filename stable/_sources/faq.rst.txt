I am a researcher. Can I use the giotto-tda in my project?
----------------------------------------------------------

Of course, the license is very permissible blablablal.

I cannot install `giotto-tda` on Windows.

Well, please use a Linux distribution.

There are many TDA-libraries available. How is `giotto-tda` different?

It's the best!
