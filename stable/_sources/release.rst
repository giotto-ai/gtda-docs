*************
Release 0.1.4
*************

Library name change
===================
The library and GitHub repository have been renamed to ``giotto-tda``! While the
new name is meant to better convey the library's focus on Topology-powered
machine learning and Data Analysis, the commitment to seamless integration with
``scikit-learn`` will remain just as strong and a defining feature of the project.
Concurrently, the main module has been renamed from ``giotto`` to ``gtda`` in this
version. ``giotto-learn`` will remain on PyPI as a legacy package (stuck at v0.1.3)
until we have ensured that users and developers have fully migrated. The new PyPI
package ``giotto-tda`` will start at v0.1.4 for project continuity.

Short summary: install via ::

    pip install -U giotto-tda

and ``import gtda`` in your scripts or notebooks!

Change of license
=================

The license changes from Apache 2.0 to GNU AGPLv3 from this release on.

Major Features and Improvements
===============================
-  Added a ``mapper`` submodule implementing the Mapper algorithm of Singh, Mémoli and Carlsson. The main tools are the
   functions ``make_mapper_pipeline``, ``plot_static_mapper_graph`` and ``plot_interactive_mapper_graph``. The first
   creates an object of class ``MapperPipeline`` which can be fit-transformed to data to create a Mapper graph in the
   form of an ``igraph.Graph`` object (see below). The ``MapperPipeline`` class itself is a simple subclass
   of scikit-learn's ``Pipeline`` which is adapted to the precise structure of the Mapper algorithm, so that a
   ``MapperPipeline`` object can be used as part of even larger scikit-learn pipelines, inside a meta-estimator, in a
   grid search, etc. One also has access to other important features of scikit-learn's ``Pipeline``, such as memory
   caching to avoid unnecessary recomputation of early steps when parameters involved in later steps are changed.
   The clustering step can be parallelised over the pullback cover sets via ``joblib`` -- though this can actually
   *lower* performance in small- and medium-size datasets. A range of pre-defined filter functions are also included,
   as well as covers in one and several dimensions, agglomerative clustering algorithms based on stopping rules to
   create flat cuts, and utilities for making transformers out of callables or out of other classes which have no
   ``transform`` method. ``plot_static_mapper_graph`` allows the user to visualise (in 2D or 3D) the Mapper graph
   arising from fit-transforming a ``MapperPipeline`` to data, and offers a range of colouring options to correlate the
   graph's structure with exogenous or endogenous information. It relies on ``plotly`` for plotting and displaying
   metadata. ``plot_interactive_mapper_graph`` adds interactivity to this, via ``ipywidgets``: specifically, the user
   can fine-tune some parameters involved in the definition of the Mapper pipeline, and observe in real time how the
   structure of the graph changes as a result. In this release, all hyperparameters involved in the covering and
   clustering steps are supported. The ability to fine-tune other hyperparameters will be considered for future versions.
-  Added support for Python 3.8.

Bug Fixes
=========
-  Fixed consistently incorrect documentation for the ``fit_transform`` methods. This has been achieved by introducing a
   class decorator ``adapt_fit_transform_docs`` which is defined in the newly introduced ``gtda.utils._docs.py``.

Backwards-Incompatible Changes
==============================
-  The library name change and the change in the name of the main module ``giotto``
   are important major changes.
-  There are now additional dependencies in the ``python-igraph``, ``matplotlib``, ``plotly``, and ``ipywidgets`` libraries.

-  ``giotto.time_series`` implements transformers to preprocess time series or embed them in a higher dimensional space for persistent homology.
-  ``giotto.graphs`` implements transformers to create graphs or extract metric spaces from graphs.
-  ``giotto.meta_transformers`` implements convenience ``giotto.Pipeline`` transformers for direct topological feature generation.
-  ``giotto.utils`` implements hyperparameters and input validation functions.
-  ``giotto.base`` implements a ``TransformerResamplerMixin`` for transformers that have a resample method.
-  ``giotto.pipeline`` extends scikit-learn's module by defining Pipelines that include ``TransformerResamplers``.

We are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and
answered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions. In particular, we would like
to thank `Martino Milani <https://github.com/MartMilani/reportPACS>`_, who worked on an early
prototype of a Mapper implementation; although very different from the current one, it
adopted an early form of caching to avoid recomputation in refitting, which was an inspiration
for this implementation.
